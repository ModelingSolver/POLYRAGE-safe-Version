POLYRAGE – Polymorphic Resilient Autonomous Generative Emergent Network 🌱
Overview
Biomimetic distributed system research inspired by cellular immune response, swarm intelligence, and self-organizing networks.
Explores emergent coordination patterns in decentralized multi-agent architectures with adaptive topology and self-repair mechanisms.
Research focus: How simple autonomous agents with local rules generate complex system-level behaviors through polymorphic state transitions.

Architecture: Three Operational Modes
1. Centralized Mode (RAGE_Origin)
Tightly coordinated multi-module system:

Observer module: Anomaly detection and signal monitoring
Resilience module: System integrity and fault recovery
Response module: Adaptive reaction to environmental changes
Compute module: Analytical support and decision logic
Coordinator module: Global state evaluation and local adaptation

Communication: Secure internal protocols optimized for efficiency.
Use case: High-coordination scenarios, centralized control requirements.

2. Semi-Distributed Mode (RAGE_System)
Autonomous modules with contextual cooperation:

Each module operates independently with selective communication
Adaptive behavior based on system load and environmental stress
Emergent collaboration through functional proximity
Balanced trade-off between coordination and resilience

Use case: Dynamic environments requiring adaptability with moderate resource availability.

3. Fully Distributed Mode (RAGE_Eclats)
Micro-agent cellular architecture:

System fragments into 25+ specialized autonomous units
Each handles specific functions (observation, integrity, response, computation, analysis)
10-15 dormant agents activate only on triggering events (resilience reserve)
Zero mandatory communication – coordination emerges from local interactions
Self-cloning and topology reconfiguration for persistence

Use case: Maximum resilience scenarios, hostile or unreliable environments.

Key Research Questions

How do local interaction rules generate global emergent behaviors?
What triggers optimal polymorphic state transitions in distributed systems?
Can self-repair mechanisms operate without centralized coordination?
